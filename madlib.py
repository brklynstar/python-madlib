# Homework: Create a madlib. Imagine a story where some of the words are 
# supplied by user input. Using python you will use input to collect 
# words for a story and then display the story. 

# Use input to collect each word to a variable
# Use an f string to display the story

# Your madlib must collect at least 6 words!
